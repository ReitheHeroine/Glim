// Title:       StepsPanel.jsx
// Project:     Glim
// Author:      Reina Hastings (reinahastings13@gmail.com)
// Created:     2026-03-30
// Last Modified: 2026-03-30
// Purpose:     Companion mode panel for step tracking. Tappable hero number
//              opens the native numeric keyboard (pre-filled with current count).
//              Replace-style: submitting a new count creates a new entry; the
//              latest entry for the day is always the displayed count. Horizontal
//              tier progress bar with markers at 2.5k / 5k / 7.5k / 10k.
//              "Next milestone" pill updates live. Footer shows streak and
//              7-day average. Glim reacts on tier crossings, first-ever milestone
//              days, streak milestones, and regular log events.
// Inputs:      Reads from useStepsStore, useCreatureStore, useMessageStore.
//              No props required.
// Outputs:     Steps panel content (rendered inside CompanionPanel)
