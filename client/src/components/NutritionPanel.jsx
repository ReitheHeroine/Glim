// Author:      Reina Hastings (reinahastings13@gmail.com)
// Created:     2026-04-04
// Last Modified: 2026-04-05
// Purpose:     Nutrition tracking companion panel. Renders inside CompanionPanel
//              when activePanel === 'nutrition'. Four horizontal two-tier progress
//              bars (protein, fiber, fruit, veggie). Inline raw-add via "+" buttons.
//              Food library quick-add with search. Undo toast. Expandable streak
//              footer. Full message pools with multi-event sequencing.
// Inputs:      useNutritionStore, useNutritionLibraryStore, useMessageStore.
//              No props.
// Outputs:     Panel content div (height: 100%, manages its own scroll split)
