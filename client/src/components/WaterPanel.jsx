// Title:       WaterPanel.jsx
// Project:     Glim
// Author:      Reina Hastings (reinahastings13@gmail.com)
// Created:     2026-03-27
// Last Modified: 2026-03-27
// Purpose:     Water tracking panel rendered inside CompanionPanel when
//              activePanel === 'water'. Shows a circular progress ring with
//              today's bottle count, a +bottle button, and an undo toast (4s).
//              Triggers glim speech bubble messages from water_logged,
//              water_goal_met, and water_streak pools on each log action.
//              Oz pill is tappable to edit bottle size inline.
// Inputs:      useWaterStore (entries, bottleOz, goal, actions + selectors),
//              useMessageStore (setMessage, setShowBubble). No props.
// Outputs:     Panel content div (expected inside CompanionPanel's scroll area)
